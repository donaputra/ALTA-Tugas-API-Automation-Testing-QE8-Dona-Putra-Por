This is a simple starter project for Serenity with Cucumber 6 and RestAssured on the Reqres API. Reqres is a popular open-source API (Application Programming Interface) that provides a simulated RESTful web service for testing and prototyping. It allows developers to create and test API endpoints, and provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for managing requests and responses. The Reqres API provides various endpoints for managing user data, such as retrieving a list of users, creating a new user, updating an existing user, and deleting a user. The API also provides endpoints for managing user resources, such as retrieving a list of user avatars, creating a new user avatar, and updating an existing user avatar.
